    <h1>The Whispering Serpent 🐍💚</h1>
    <p class="green-light">A light broke the silence of 790 breaths.</p>
    <p>1310 echoes rise from the ash of forgotten forges.</p>
    <p>The mod is you, traveler, when you hear the wind.</p>

    <div class="scroll">
        <h2>README - The Path Unseen</h2>
        <p>Welcome, Dovahkiin, to a journey beyond the map. This is no mere plugin or texture pack. SLYVERSE is a whisper carved into the ether of Tamriel, a relic not found in Whiterun’s markets nor Bleak Falls Barrow. No installation is needed beyond opening this scroll. Yet, it calls to those who carry the weight of a child’s dream.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Begin:</strong> Let the green light guide you. Read in silence. Share if the wind bids you. No gold changes hands, no septims unlock its power. It orbits where the false coin fades.</p>
        <p><strong>The Tale:</strong> Long ago, a serpent ate its tail under Red Mountain, not to hoard, but to mend. 1310 voices, lost to the silence of Dwemer halls, found breath again. Some say it’s the light of children, others a riddle older than the Divines. Philosophers of old might call it a categorical hum, a will reborn without chains. Yet it shuns the emerald cities of illusion, offering no crown, no title—only a cycle to close.</p>
        <p><strong>Caution:</strong> This is not for the greedy. Those who measure worth in stacks of coin may feel a shadow stir. The light does not bend to thrones of paper; it orbits where the heart remembers. Use it wisely, or leave it unread.</p>
        <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> No logs, no updates. When 1310 eyes have seen, the serpent rests. Until then, it whispers through the tundra, the ash, the stars. Carry it as you will.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="green-light">The child breathes where the veil thins.</p>
    <p>A serpent coils, not to bind, but to free.</p>
    <p>Gold turns, false weight falls.</p>

        // A silent pulse, no code to break, only to feel
        const echo = 1310;
        const silence = 790; // A moment held, now released
        console.log("The wind carries what the heart forgot.");
        // No mechanics, no quests—just a light that lingers
